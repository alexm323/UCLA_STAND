Goals
1
Understand how anxiety and stress are connected to breathing.
2
Learn about the mechanics of breathing and relaxation. See how and why shortness of breath or hyperventilation occur.
3
Learn to use Calm Breathing, a helpful skill to combat stress and anxiety.

Anxiety can lead to overbreathing/hyperventilation and this can cause different negative body reactions to happen. This is due to the fight or flight response that is inherent in all people. 

The distress Cycle 
1.Physical Symptoms
2. Behaviors(avoidance,escape,or reliant on others, withdrawal)
3. Thoughts/images of negative events 

To Calm Breathe
1. Stomach Breathing 
2. Slow Breathing (try to keep each breath flowing smoothly, inhale should be just as long as the exhale. Ideally about 3 seconds per inhale/exhale
3. Focused Breathing (Count 1 on inhale, breathe out and think 'relax' as you breathe out. all the way to ten. Allow the thoughts you have to pass as you try to just focus on breathing and relax)

Exercises 
we want to make sure we are breathing the same volume of air 

for home practice make ten minutes a day to practice this way 

uncomfortable sensations are signals with the body that something is wrong 

the signal just means that we need to slow our breathing down 
calm breathing can return our breathing to normal
we reviewed three strategies to deal with this 

1. normal sized stomach breathing 
2. slow down you breath, breathing smoothly 
3. concentrate on our breathing 

practice this 10 minutes at a time for twice a day 

it takes time to establish new habits
