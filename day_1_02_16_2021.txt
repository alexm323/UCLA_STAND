Week 1 basic skills training 
intros
overview of the program
introduction to mindfulness
basic process skills 

there is a package system so that we can work on comorbidity 
sometimes someone has depression and anxietry or trauma together, so we can tackle things together 

there are some packages that combine different skills 

stand is personalized 

meant to match the patients based on the stressoirs and symptoms 
we want to target the specific areas that patients are struggling with 

STAND emphasizes practice 

participants in panic and trauma pacages recive the same coach for the entire package of the modules 

Mindfulness vs meditaiton

mindfulness is not exactly meditation 

it is not to push away the thoughts but it is to focus on the present moment without judgment 
we think OH that was a judgemental thought 

it is just to be more aware of the present moment without trying to change anything 
focus on one thing at a time 

reduces overthinking , distraction, negative thoughts and feelings 

increase pleasure sense of well being 

Dialectical behavioral therapy 
developed for individuals who really suffer through very heavy emotional swings 
wheere it takes them longer to get out of negative feelings back to baseline normal

The three types of mindfulness 
_________________________________
observe-wordless watching
describe - putting words on the experience (sticking to the facts, without interpreting)
participate - throw yourself into the moment fully (dont worry about yesterday , dont focus on tomrrow, throw yourself into the zone)

drive and listen app is awesome on heroku 

find some mindfulness exercises 

mindfulness in STAND 

a way to help us be authentic in the present moment , genuineness, connection and attunement with participants 

get out of your head kind of thing 

what do i do next 

with more mindfulness practice we can be more in tune with the present moment 

we will be doing that with participants as well 

6 core process skills 


1. Authenticity
- interacting with participants in a genuine way
being truthful and honest 
speaking from a compassionate and empathetic place
attending to the present moment 
connecting with the participant 


2. Nonverbal Skills

showing participants you are listening to them 
making eye contact 
demonstrating open body language
facial expressions 
not interrupting 

3. Open Ended QUestions 

when yoy ask open questions instead of giving advice 

4. Reflecting Emotions
reflecting what the person is sayig to understand their emotions 
'im noticing that this is very difficult for you to talk about' 
this has to be combined with authenticity 

5. Content Summaries 

reflecting what the people are actually saying 
ask for correction 
you were feeling overwhelmed and then you decided to call a friend 
tried to do the module but you just dont get it 
(sounds like you did your best to get through the module , thats fantastic) encourage that positive behavior 

6. Avoid Advice Giving 

we are all pulled to give advice and we want to resist that urge and avoid giving advice 
help them process what they are going through and dont direct them 

let them grow on their own 

sometimes you just want to talk about a problem without getting a fix
it can make you feel like youre not being heard

people are more likely to learn and consolidate information if they are getting help on their own 

using content summaries are a good way to help the person understand that our intent is really to hear them out and understand where they are coming from 

3 core components of role play response 

-represent important coaching session goals 
-validate the persons ecperience and emotions
-reinforce positive behaviors
-use open ended questions to clarify troubleshoot and enhance skill application 

VALIDATION IS

acknowledging and accepting their inner experience 
there are lots of ways to share their thoughts and feelings and behaviors as valid and understandable 

it is not:
agreement
giving compliments
reinforcement
judgement 

they drink a bottle of wine every night 

you dont have to agree you can say that 'wow i see you are having a really hard time. i feel you and i get it.'
you want to catch and be aware of a judgement but still provide a validating response 

for the next week try to see when you get validation and dont get validation in your life
