Strategies to deal with stress 

1. Slowing Things down
-Slowing things down does not mean doing less; rather, it means focusing on one thing at a time and pacing yourself. Taking short breaks between tasks can also be helpful.

2. Opposite Action
-If feeling tense or irritable is a warning sign, a good plan is to do something calming and relaxing.
-If feeling low and lacking energy is a warning sign, a good ‘Then’ plan is do something positive and energizing.
-Opposite Action just means deciding to act in different ways so you don’t get stuck in those negative emotions

Rumination 

if I think about all this then I will be prepared to handle the situation but it really feels like it makes it worse 

we have our own reasons to worry and stress about events 

Helpful thinking vs worry and rumination 

How to Judge When it is Unhelpful to Worry and Ruminate
To Worry or Not to Worry

There are three rules that will tell you when it is and isn’t helpful to keep thinking about problems and difficulties.

Rule 1: Is this an unanswerable question?
-Some things are too complicated to know what the best solution is. Sometimes it isn’t possible to find an answer because there are so many possible outcomes.

Rule 2: Have I already been ruminating about this for more than 30 minutes?
-Keep in mind how long you have been worrying.
-Helpful thinking usually leads to an answer in half an hour.

Rule 3: Do my thoughts lead to a plan or action?
-If your thoughts about a problem only lead to more thoughts, then you will likely end up in a spiral of worry and inactivity. However, when your thoughts about a problem lead to action to solve that problem, then the thoughts are much more likely to be helpful.

1. What are you worried about?

2. Is this an unanswerable question? 

If so, then it may not be helpful to keep thinking about it.

3. Have you already been thinking about this for more than 30 minutes?

If you have been thinking about a problem for more than 30 minutes and have not identified a helpful solution, you are unlikely to identify one by continuing to ruminate in this moment.

4. Do your thoughts lead to a plan or action?

If your thoughts about a problem only lead to more thoughts, then you will likely end up in a spiral of worry and inactivity.

Learning from experience 

take notice of when and where your actions work 

While it is important to continue to try different ways of responding to stress, it is also important to learn the responses that most often reduce discomfort for you. You will want to learn the responses you notice as being most helpful. 

Look at what makes a situation different, memorable, and unique.
Notice what makes an event different from other similar occasions.

It is also helpful to ask yourself the following questions to be more specific and to notice what is going on – What? Where? Who? When? How? (but not Why?)
