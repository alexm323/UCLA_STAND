Goals
1
Understand that your thoughts about a situation influence how you feel and behave.
2
Learn the difference between general versus specific thinking.
3
Practice getting specific to reduce stress, anxiety and depression.
4
Practice identifying when you feel stuck in general thinking. Learn to ask yourself questions that help you get specific.

A negative thought might start because you overheard your name and then it makes think people were talking badly about you etc 

it hard to stop the flow of negative thought 

focus on specific thoughts 

Notice and focus on what actually happened and how it happened 

focus on the details of a situation and stop you from falling into downward spiral of rumination and worry

Specific Thinking will help you take note of all the facts, put things into perspective, and take action to solve these problems.

1) Imagine that you make a careless mistake on an important exam. How would you respond if you thought: “I made a mistake. Everything I do always goes wrong!"

I always make this kind of mistake. Im stupid and Ill never pass because im not smart enough to pass or to know these things. 

2) On the other hand, how would you respond if you thought: “I made a mistake, but I was tired. I had been studying all day without a break. I just misread the third question as I hurried to finish it. I still have the chance to get a good grade in the class." 

I should rest more before taking a test and I should take regular breaks to make sure im not getting burnt out. I still have time to get a good grade and Im doing well overall in the class 

general vs specific

general way: does not encourage you to find a solution 
it is all about the whys and what ifs 
what does this mean about me 
what if things had been different 

reasons, meanings, consequences and implications 

specific thinking:
what when where and how the situation happened 
being specific gives you clues on how to solve problems and how to solve them in the future 

instead of saying what if i fail, get good sleep, take your time on a test, and practice good test taking strategies

audio scenario 

it was asking about a time i got stood up 

I dont have to imagine because I have had it happen. 
I felt worthless and sad, really tense, I cried in the car, was feeling panicked and unfocused. 
Zero confidence level and low energy 


second audio scenario , notice everything happening 

I remember I got some pancakes I paid and left, the food was good, the coffee was food, there were a lot of people there for an early weekday morning and I sat in a corner and just quickly ate my food and left. 

I was still a 7/10 sadness 
tense is at a 6 
calm is at an 8 
energetic is at a 4
focused is at a 7
confident is at a 4 

Felt like I was really just worthless in the first exercise , like something was wrong with me that meant people shouldnt want to meet me and of course they wouldnt 

second exercise though I noticed that the food was good and I had taken the advice that I find somewhere with good food at least in case I get stood up. Interesting to plan for and have to execute that plan and then I remember being a little angry because I was foregoing sleep to meet this person for breakfast and that really sucked 

Tips to encourage specific thinking 
__________________________________________________
1. Focus on what your senses are telling you 
notice the details of where you are and what you are doing 
what is specific about the situation and setting 
what is happening, how, where, with whom, how is it different from other events 

2. Notice the sequence of events and your behavior
Be aware of what comesbefore and what follows each action and event 
notice the series of steps,actions, and events that lead up to an event 
Look out for clues and warning signs 
Look out for turning points - Hwere could a different decision action or circumstance changed what happened 
ask yourself - how did this come about? what are the warning signs? what might change the outcome?

3. Focus on how you can move forward 
a. Plan - Ask yourself how you can break things down into small, manageable steps that you can use to solve problems 
b. ACt - Take the first step in the chain of actions to deal with a given difficulty. Act step by step dealing with new difficulties as they arise. Acknowledge your progress when things go well 
c. Ask - How can i move forward ? How can I break this down into smaller steps? what is the first step I can take?
