Feeling detached and distanced 

It is difficult to be connected with what is going on if your mind is somewhere else 
unhelpful habits like worrying can distract us from the present moment 

we are not connecting to the present experience. 

this can make stress and depression worse when you are disconnected 
you dont learn from your success or failure 

being in the present moment and being absorbed 

NEW SKILL 
Being Absorbed (entering the flow state?)
being fully engaged in the activity that you are doing, in the zone 

when you are absorbed, your body is fully concentrated on the activity that youare in 
you might even lose track of time because of this 

it happens when you are totally caught up in that moment 
you feel more enjoyment and happiness from being in the activity 

you might be cooking a meal for your family , you dont notice the noise around you
engrossed in a good book 
everyone has different memories depending on the activity that they were absorbed in 

exercises:

1. Distracted: Thinking of different things , I was not engaged in the coding , kids were distracting, i was stressed out, didnt want to think , struggling to be involved. was paying attention to my phone, waiting for someone to respond. Struggled to fully engage in the activity. What did you feel or think of. 

1. If you were to rate how tense you feel right now from 0 to 10, what would it be?
7/10
2. If you were to rate how calm you feel right now from 0 to 10, what would it be?
8/10
3. If you were to rate how energetic you feel right now from 0 to 10, what would it be?
7/10
4. If you were to rate how focused you feel right now from 0 to 10, what would it be?
5/10

2. Fully Engaged: That day I was able to do several pomodoros 
I was fully engaged and fully productive. 

when we are fully engaged we are fully activating the 5 senses 
they get us directly in touch with our present experiences 
this is a fram of mind that helps us get active 

Using the exercises
______________________________________________
You can use the Being Absorbed listening exercise in three ways to deal with stress and feeling stuck. 

1. You can use this exercise to adopt a helpful way of thinking. This may put you into a more upbeat state of mind and acts against worry and getting stuck in the past.

2. You can use this exercise to increase your motivation. When you are absorbed, you are more motivated to do things. It is also easier to fully enjoy what you are doing. So, you could use the absorption exercise to get yourself into the right frame of mind for an activity. This will increase your chance of getting started and increase your enjoyment in what you are doing.

3. You can use this exercise as a guide to find activities that give you the most enjoyment and benefit. The activities that excite, interest and motivate you are powerful in busting depression. These are the kind of activities that will recharge you and give you more energy. In contrast, the chores and obligations you feel you should do might drain your resources and energy. Being absorbed can help you increase the number of positive activities that you do. It can also help you get even more enjoyment from them.

There is a being absorbed work sheet to use for this exercise as well 

______________________________________________
Increase the amount of absorbing activities that you do 
______________________________________________

In what ways is this true for you?

What effects does this have for you?

What are the absorbing activities that you can do more of in order to improve your mood? These activities could be anything. Examples include washing dishes, having conversations with a friend, studying, playing music, playing sports, etc. You can list anything you find absorbing. Consider saving this list of absorbing activities as a document or putting it someplace you'll see it (like on a post-it on your computer or on the fridge). That way, you'll be reminded of these activities and will be more likely to actually do them.

Practicing gratitude
______________________________________________
Being thankful 

You can be thankful for anything , including being able to take your next breath 

I GET to do this, I dont HAVE to do this 

Things you can do to practice being grateful:
1. Make a gratitude list of things that you are grateful for each day 
2. Gratitude letter - Thanking someone in your life that you don't have to send 

Change up the gratefulness if it starts to feel old 
try a gratefulness jar?
Try to focus on specific things you appreciate about important people in your life. These could even be people you are not in touch with on a regular basis. Thinking about people might be easier than thinking about material items.

Dear Adina,

Thank you for being in my life. You bring such joy and energy and spontaneity to every experience. Thank you for listening to my stories and supporting me always. I'm lucky to have someone as loyal and generous as you in my circle. I know that no matter what happens, you'll have my back. I'm so grateful for the way you are always ready for an adventure. Thank you for being the person I can have challenging conversations with. I always leave those hard conversations knowing that we still care deeply for each other. I love watching you shine in all that you do. It inspires me to shine that brightly, too.

 Love you,

K

generosity
______________________________________________

Generosity is the act of giving without expecting anything in return. It can take many forms. It can mean giving objects, information, empathy, financial support, language, time, resources, experience, and love. Higher levels of generosity are associated with higher levels of positive mood. Our mood increases more when we do something generous for someone else than when someone does something generous for us. Also, research has shown that simply witnessing generosity can increase our mood. The neurons in our brain behave the same way when we witness as when we perform generous acts.

this can be one way to stay in the moment 
can be small and big acts 

helping a friend
giving a compliment 
bringing someone a coffee 

all generous deeds create positive emotions 

There is a worksheet about targeted generosity 

Sometimes the most generous act is the practice of self care and recognizing our own needs. 
Giving without expecting to even be appreciated leaves more room for positive emotions 

Review
Being absorbed is being absorbed in the present moment. There is no room in your head for running commentary 
The outcome of an absorbing activity is not what matters 
getting absorbed can help improve mood, and reduce worry

Things I feel grateful for 
if you practice them repeatedly you can think of more and more 
make a gratitude list 
you can express gratitude to someone in your life 

Practicing Absorption: Practice becoming absorbed using the Being Absorbed tool. Try to remember a positive absorbing memory or activity when you feel stuck in worry. You can also use this tool when you want to start doing something and are in need of some extra motivation.
Practicing Gratitude: List 3-5 things for which you are grateful in the next week; use the Gratitude List tool. Try not to list the same 3-5 things in each list. There should be at least one situation or one thing that you are grateful for that did not appear in your previous list. You can also try writing a gratitude letter to someone or something instead.
Practicing Acts of Kindness: You can do something as simple as holding open a door for another person. Or you could do something more specific for someone you know. You could also practice an act of kindness toward yourself.
