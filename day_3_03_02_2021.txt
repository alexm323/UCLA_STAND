Facing Your Inner Critic
Let's start by imagining an example of a potentially difficult time for you. Start with something that is not overly distressing, but enough to get a sense of your internal self-critic. 

Exercise
What was your inner voice ? 
You did it to yourself you deserve this , you're stupid for getting hurt again 
Why would anybody want you 
I feel like I want to cry , my heart was pounding 

This is typically how I talk to myself when stressed

______________________________________________________
A moment of kindness 

I remember when I was crying at the lodge in the underground 
Brayan helped me out , he came to see me and I was just a broken person 
tried to encourage me and help me , they all did 
woo always tried to get me going too 

he was always saying stuff with a smirk and making jokes trying to lift the mood 

I smiled thinking back to it 

He was way more encouraging and support then i thought I deserved

Kindness pouring out 

I imagined myself being there for kyle 
Kyle youve got this man , we are here to support you , I want to see you do well and I am here for you , call me whenever man we can talk about anything I want to hear about you succeeding
I would say it clearly, kindly and encouragingly 

I might put my arm over his shoulder and just from a place of my own personal pain and desire to just know that someone else is out there 

I would hope they can tackle their problem with a little more peace of mind afterwards 

I talk to other people a lot more kindly than I speak to myself 

______________________________________________________
Talking to yourself 

I almost always talk to myself in an unkind way 
If I could be kinder to myself I would probably feel a lot better about myself and the things I am trying to accomplish 
I might not sink into a depression everytime.

5 suggested ways to talk to yourself more kindly 

1. The situation you find yourself in is normal - Everyone makes mistakes, you dont have to be perfect 
2. Focus on any progress made - Point out the hard work you have already done and the steps you have already completed and the progress you have made 
3. Highlight Success and Strength - Focus on all the positive traits that allow you to find success 
4. Put the situation into perspective - A bad mood will pass, other opportunities will come along. Focus on the process and learning and not the overall problem solution. Keep trying , eventually you will be able to do it 
5. Encourage yourself onto the next step - You are strong, break the problem down into smaller steps and focus on getting the next step done

Practicing talking to yourself more kindly 

my divorce 

1
The situation you find yourself in is normal.
- A lot of people get divorced but honestly i was lucky to realize it really early before further damage was done and I was probably stuck forever 
2
Focus on any progress made. 
- I have grown and learned a lot in the past few years, I am physically, mentally, and emotionally more healthy than I was before
3
Highlight success and strengths.
- I am intelligent and I am capable and I can multitask and do a lot of things at once 
4
Put the situation into perspective. 
- I am just sad that I have to be alone for a while. On the other hand I 'get' to be alone for a while. Do whatever I want whenever I want. It is a pretty freeing feeling 
5
Encourage yourself onto the next step. 
- I can become an engineer, I can lose the weight, and I can heal my emotional scars. I can become proud of myself. Honestly I already am.

It might feel strange planning to do LESS of something. To help you think about it, here is an example of Doing Less: 

I should stay up late working less often during times when I'm exhausted. It feels like I always have work to do, but sometimes, I really can't concentrate when it's late at night and I'm so tired.

Pick a night where I won't stay up late working. 
Arrange my schedule so that I can free up my time for that night. 
Plan a relaxing activity for that night to take care of myself instead of working a lot.

Cultural fit 

Culture allows us to see context and 

1 part is skill use 
the other is cultural humility 

exploring how it 

Cultural identity 

Gender Male 
Sex Male 
Race LatinX 
Ethnicity - mexican 
Sexual 


Cultural biases , we should not constrict to the labels that they try to identify us as 

without feeling like we have to fit these molds 

there is so much nuance and complexity 

there is a lot of opportunity to practice the 6 process skills 

listening

Tomar is really focused on what the mechanism is 

we have to be actively practicing how to incorporate the skills 

what does cultural humility mean ?

we are really talking about reflection, slef learning, and life long learning 

Approach participants with sense of openness egolessness learning and listening to understand vs listening to talk 

goal is to increase awareness of biases , assumptions and expectations that we bring into our work based on our own experiences and background 

there is no end or discrete point at which we know it all this is a process of lifelo9ng learning and refliection 


Cultural competence is a different model 
we are not trying to get to a point where we understand everyone we just want to think of 

the goal of speaking about privilige 
is to realize that we all have identities that we think are marginalized and we all have some that are priviliged
