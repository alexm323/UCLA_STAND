the secrets of successful relationships 

rupture and repair 

every relationship is susceptible to rupture and repair 

rupotures are usually small
outside observers cant see it usually 

an idea gets dismissed 
partner gets mad at a story that makes them look foolish 
an affair begins
someone calls someone a stupid fool 
forgets a birthday 
this says nothing about the state of a relationship 

there might be a couple of moments between disagreements 

repair is the work that needs to go into the relationship 
repair is the mastery of emotioinal maturity 

1. the ability to apologize 
-it isnt just the few words to say. it is a challenge to someones self love . it can feel like a demand too far because we feel unworthy and it feels so obvious already
-it feels like we wouldnt deserve forgiveness 
2. the ability to forgive 
-people can make mistakes because we are sad or weak 
-decent people can behave less than optimal 
-splitting is a way of describing people as either pure good or evil 
-either someone is perfect or they are abhorrent 
-we cling to rupture because we think that other people cant be trusted and we are all alone 

3. the ability to teach 
-there was something they were trying teach or how to behave 
-what to do about sex
-what to do about children 
-we forget about the art of good teaching 
-the ability to understand what a teacher wants out of them 
-they swallow a very large of pessimism in order to stay calm around some of the inevitable frustrations of relationships 
-they may have to accept two different realities 
- you might always be misunderstood even by someone that they lvoe 

4. the ability to learn 
-get hung up on how they tried to inform us of an idea 
- they can accept how flawed they may be 
-the good repairer is a good learner 
-they understand how much left they have to take on board 
-merely a sign that they can notice area of immaturity 
-offered feedback and able to accept it 
-we should do something of the same 

self acceptance 
patience
humility
courage

Common thinking Traps 

Black and white thinking: Only looking at situations in terms of one extreme or the other. A situation is either good or bad, a success or failure – there is no middle ground.


bullet
Mind reading: Assuming that you know what someone else is thinking without them actually saying it.


bullet
Jumping to conclusions: Believing that bad things are much more likely to happen than they really are.


bullet
Blowing things out of proportion: Viewing negative events as bigger or worse than they really are. You may think a situation is very bad, unbearable or disastrous. But in reality it is just frustrating or difficult.


blowing things out of proportion 
-may think of situations as unbearable or disastrous 
-if others notice I was anxious i couldnt face thaem
- cant handle confrontration 
- if i cant finish this on time then I am a failure 
- being stressed makes us blow things out of proprtion 
- even under the worst circumstances  we can put things in proportion 

face your worries head on 
what exactly am i thinking about and what am i worried about 
no matter how intense your fear is, t will not physically harm you
there is almost always a way of coping with even the worst situations 

instead of seeing the situation as horrible terrible or awful
see it as a survivable situation 

1. will it pass with time?
2. will i feel differently eventually?
3. am i certain that the negative thing I am predicting will happen?
4. do i have to be perfect?
5. do i have to be liked by everyone?
6. is it ok if i make mistakes?

go from awful to not so awful 

thinking traps from before 


"I’m not going to finish my paper on time, and then I’m going to fail the class, lose my scholarship and get kicked out of school. Then I’ll have to move home. I’ll be a complete failure who has let my family down."



"I fell into two thinking traps here: First, I Jumped to Conclusions. I assumed that I was not going to finish the paper, even though I still have a week until it’s due. It’s possible that I could work really hard and manage to turn it in before the deadline. Second, I Blew Things out of Proportion. I went from not submitting the paper on time to getting kicked out of school. And I worried that I would have to move home. I think that even if I turned it in late or not at all, I might still pass the course. I might just get a very bad grade. Or if I was going to fail, I might be able to withdraw. Then I could retake the course next semester. And I don’t think that they would take away my scholarship if I failed this one course."


thoughts are not facts

instead of believing our guesses and thoughts lets try to examine the evidence 
emotions can often have us believe in our negative thoughts 
ask yourself these questions about what we are worried about 

Has this ever happened before?
How likely is it? How many times have I worried about it happening? How many times has it actually happened?
What is the evidence that it will not happen?


try challenging negative thoughts with all the evidence you have available

we can be sure that your chance of not failing is pretty high 

when you focus on the facts of the situation we can see that the odds can usually be in our favor
