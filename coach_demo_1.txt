goals of a coaching sesssion 

1. help with challenges a participant is facing 
help them facitilate skills 
procide a safe space validation 
reinforce participants for engaging in mental health trreatment 
procide participants with positive expereience with mental health 

try to provide the participant a good experience so that the next time they are not afraid to engage in mental health services if they need them
